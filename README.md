# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
Final Project documents from Sprint/Agile Class (SNHU)

Question 1 

-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? 

-Interpreting user needs and transitioning those ideas into working software is a core aspect that agile scrum seeks to optimize. By creating a system of communication where to customer is able to openly discuss ideas with the project manager, a line if information can be made where the customers' needs are always the forefront ideas when developing software. User Stories allow the team to take these ideas presented by the customers and form them into realistic goals the team can work on. 


Question 2 

-How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? 

-In Developing software, complexity can quickly lead a project into dismay. Agile allows teams to work together in such a way that everyone takes the load for keeping projects simple and minimal to their required use cases. In applying agile practices to my professional life I hope to focus on separating problems and development process into user stories or similar structured events so that work may flow unobstructed. 


Question 3 

-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 

-Being a good team member is not just being good at your job. It means going out of your way to create open communication with your team members and allowing them the ability to present ideas without personal judgement. The role of a team member in scrum is not to rise above the team, but to help the team as a unit in progressing and optimizing workflow.
